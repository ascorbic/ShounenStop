question: "What happens if my order is stuck in customs?"
answer: "
  Please continue to be patient and wait for your order to clear customs. We
  assure you that this situation is rare, as the US has a much higher tax and
  duties threshold compared to other countries.\nIf you are contacting us to
  purchase from a different country, please also understand that there is always
  a chance that your items can be delayed or seized by customs from your
  country.\nWe take no responsibility for packages ultimately seized by customs,
  as such situation is beyond our control."
