question: How do returns work?
answer: "If items received were damaged in transit or lost in the mail, we will
  claim insurance and refund you in full. Please note that Comiket items are
  non-refundable if the dimensions of the item are different from your
  expectations (i.e. size, thickness, materials). Please understand that these
  dimensions are determined by the doujin circles themselves, and they often do
  not provide much information on their official Japanese sites. "
