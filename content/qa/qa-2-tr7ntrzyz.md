question: "Q: What happens if I donâ€™t receive my item?"
answer: "The Hong Kong post is quite efficient and reliable, and all packages
  shipped will have tracking. Tracking to the US and Canada however, has a
  slightly unconventional system of sending a physical request form to the Hk
  Post to communicate with US/Canadian postal services to track the item. In the
  case that goods do not arrive, send us and email with your order number, and
  we will send this request for the Hk post to conduct an investigation. If the
  investigation after 1-2 months concludes that the item is lost, we will claim
  insurance and then provide you with a refund. "
