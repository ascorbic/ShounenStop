question: Can I sleeve my Yugioh cards with standard sized sleeves?
answer: Yes, we would recommend a triple sleeve setup. First, place the Yugioh
  card inside a perfect fit clear sleeve, and then inside a standard-sized
  sleeve. This minimizes the movement of the Yugioh card being inside a
  larger-sized sleeve. Then put the standard sleeve inside a standard-sized
  oversleeve. Matte Yugioh sleeves also work if you do not mind the color
  bordering inside the standard-sized sleeve. Remember to have the oversleeve
  cover the standard sleeve's opening on the top. Check out our in stock items
  for oversleeves.
