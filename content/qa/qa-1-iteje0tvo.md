question: How does shipping work and where can items be shipped to?
answer: "We offer Shounen Style Shipping by default on all carts. Item(s) will
  be sent with tracking using the Hong Kong post's e-Express service. For more
  information, visit the checkout page. Please email us if you reside in a
  country other than the US, as our site at the moment only offers to ship to
  those residing in the US. We will be happy to accommodate you. "
