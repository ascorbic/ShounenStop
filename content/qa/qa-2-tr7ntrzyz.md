question: What happens if my order is stuck in customs?
answer: >
  Please continue to be patient and wait for your package(s) to clear customs.
  We assure you that this situation is very uncommon, as the US has much higher
  duties & tax threshold than most countries. If you are contacting us to
  purchase from a different country, please also understand that there is always
  a chance that your item(s) can be delayed or seized by the customs of your
  country. We take no responsibility for packages ultimately seized by customs,
  as such a situation is beyond our control.
