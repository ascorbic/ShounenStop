question: What happens when a shipment is stuck in customs?
answer: >
  Please continue to be patient and wait for your package(s) to clear customs.
  We assure you that this situation is very uncommon, as the US has a much
  higher duties & tax threshold than most countries. If you are contacting us to
  purchase from a different country, please also understand that there is always
  a chance that your item(s) can be delayed or seized by the customs of your
  country. We will declare all shipments as gifts and write the lowest
  reasonable value on the shipment to minimize the chance of any border delay.
  Please pay any import fees for delivery if required, we take no responsibility
  for packages delayed by customs, as such a situation is beyond our control.
