question: What happens if my order gets lost in transit?
answer: >
  We will send an inquiry to the Hong Kong Post to perform an investigation on
  the status of the package(s). This process usually lasts 1-3 months, and if
  the investigation confirms the status of lost in transit, we will claim
  insurance and then refund you in full. Please note that this situation is very
  uncommon, as the Hong Kong Post is known to be one of the most reliable
  couriers in Asia.
